## About Me
I am a 24 year old just starting out with programming. I have enjoyed what I have done so far with Java and like the methodical approach it requires. I come from an artistic background and have a creative mind. I also have practical knowledge of various hands-on skills, such as basic electrical wiring, carpentry, and welding. I love learning new things and my excellent memory alows me to absorb knowledge quickly.
